## Overview

The **Algorithm Visualizer** is an interactive tool to understand sorting and searching algorithms through step-by-step visualizations. It includes:

- A homepage linking to sorting and searching visualizations.
- Dynamic visualizations that adapt to user inputs and screen sizes.

## Features

### Sorting Visualization

- Algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, and Heap Sort.
- Features: Adjustable array size, animation speed, and step-by-step highlights.

### Searching Visualization

- Algorithms: Linear and Binary Search.
- Features: Dynamic array generation, adjustable speed, and step-by-step search highlights.

## Usage

1. Navigate to Sorting or Searching from the homepage.
2. Select an algorithm, configure options, and start the visualization.

## Future Improvements

- Add more algorithms.
- Add light/dark mode themes.
